    Houston producer and vocalist Casey Luong (b. November 4, 1994) also known as keshi has beautifully progressed since first releasing music in 2013. Initially crafting lo-fi beats and using his voice as an added layer of the instrumental, keshi has since evolved into a genuine singer/songwriter.

    Jonathon Ng (born 23 December 1995), better known by his stage name EDEN, is an Irish electronic music producer turned singer-songwriter based in Dublin, Ireland. He formerly operated as The Spab Project, and would upload random songs and projects onto SoundCloud. After he had outgrown that phase, he changed his name to The Eden Project, an alias that was discontinued in 2015. Ngâ€™s work as The Eden Project typically featured more conventional styles of electronic dance music such as dubstep and drum and bass, while EDEN saw him venturing into a more indie pop style. He made this alias change in April 2015, after the release of Final Call.
